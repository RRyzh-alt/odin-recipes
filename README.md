# odin-recipes
This project is to set up a basic recipe website. This will allow me to practice and showcase the knowledge I have acquired in the HTML section in foundations of The Odin Project.

I will be creating a website with links to various webpages showing some of my favourite recipes. This will allow me to showcase my use of various tags and elements to alter text, add images and include links between webpages. For example: I will be using tags to add italics, bold text and headings. I will also be using relative links between my various pages rather than absolute links since I wont be needing to link to other websites.
